<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_TALK_04"><hpage>The bugs of your land, I have watched them, climbing towards their absolution without the flicker of a thought to what it means.<page>Aye. But isn’t it always such for those snared to serve your higher caste?<page>Our mortal mob did once act some defiance, unawares maybe, but successful in part, goaded towards it by Weavers’ will’n all.<hpage>You speak of the Citadel? Its former function has failed, but I can still sense its purpose, some. It is church and cage both.<page>Aye. Devised by your ancestors that monstrosity, and their wicked, clever minds. A system, or a web they’d likely call it, a way to keep their mother sealed in slumber, and themselves free to lavish in their false rule.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_DELIVERY"><hpage>Maker, I bring a delivery from Bellhart below, lacquer for your long work.<page>Ahh. Know you distort the order of things, Old One. It is a rare want of your caste to serve us mortal bugs.<hpage>I am not my kin, Maker. I have seen enough pain born of their dominion. As much as I may, I choose to stand apart.<page>If your blood allows it so... And my thanks still for the lacquer. Pharloom’s fresh faces will welcome its sheen.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT1_ACT3">Until cavern’s collapse, the masks must be made! </entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_REPEAT_ACT3">Enough talk, Old One. My contract remains. I’ll work till caverns’ collapse.<hpage>Very well, Maker. If it is within my power to do so, I shall see your lands saved.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_MEET">Ahh. Old One. Your kind should know it’s rude to expose me such. Unmasked, the task becomes heavy. <hpage>I had the desire to hear you lucid, Maker, though you may protest.<page>Aye. Well it’s no great shock to have you visit. I’ve felt the stirrings of our monarch, even all the way out here, the tremors of her kin brought close.<page>You’re planning a confrontation with her then? The one atop? Our great, frayed god?<hpage>Our meeting seems inevitable, though first I seek the strength to ensure a favourable outcome.<page>Ha! As I’d have guessed! Your ancient kind aren’t told to abide one another peaceably.<page>Well, assuming you prevail, I’ll ask only that my labour may continue. No matter the state of these lands, you should well know the necessity of my service.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_PREVIOUSLY_MET_ACT3">Back again, Old One? The effects of your... altercation with the pale mother... those are plainly sensed. The fate for these caverns feels grim.<page>I’ll take it things have taken a turn more complicated? Or was this the aftermath anticipated all along?<hpage>In our meeting, a mortal blow was dealt, but the monarch’s desperate death throes now threaten to take this whole kingdom with her.<page>Ha! I’m not surprised! It’s always the way, aye? Your ancient kind, vying for dominion, and us mortal bugs squashed unseen underneath.<hpage>It was freedom I sought, Maker. Naive perhaps, but this is not the fate I wished to come.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT1">All deserve a face. A chance to be! Until I wither, for the faceless I shall provide. </entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT2_ACT3">To exist, to die, a face is needed. It is the essential thing.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_DELIVERY"><hpage>Maker, I bring a delivery from Bellhart below, lacquer for your long work. <page>Good! Good! To seal. To protect. May Pharloom’s fresh faces gleam bright.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_POST">Take reward for service made, visitor! Gift for you, to spend or treasure!</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_MEET">A visitor! Grand you are. But you have already a mask. Already a face. It is for those without that I must carve. </entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT3">To work! To work! The masks must be carved.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_PEAK">Did you treat with the creature upon the summit?<page>Your legged ancestors once found her company compelling, enough to build their chambers and their calling device at the height of this perilous peak.<hpage>I have paid my respects, and been granted her favour. Her down now fills my cloak, and does much to ward against the frost of these heights.<page>To pass something so precious... That’s a mighty gift you’ve been given. Seems she’s thrown her lot in with you.<page>I’d not have guessed her so opposed to our threaded monarch, but then she too must have sensed the wretched state of things, and the harsher change to come. </entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_MEET_ACT3">Ahh. Old One. Your kind should know it’s rude to expose me such. Unmasked, the task becomes heavy. <hpage>I had the desire to hear you lucid, Maker, though you may protest.<page>Aye. Well it’s no great shock to have you visit. I’ve felt, and heard, the effects of your... altercation with the pale mother... The fate for these caverns seems grim.<page>I’ll take it things have taken a turn more complicated? Or was this the aftermath anticipated all along?<hpage>In our meeting, a mortal blow was dealt, but the monarch’s desperate death throes now threaten to take this whole kingdom with her.<page>Ha! I’m not surprised! It’s always the way, aye? Your ancient kind, vying for dominion, and us mortal bugs squashed unseen underneath.<hpage>It was freedom I sought, Maker, for myself and for you mortal few. Naive perhaps, but this is not the fate I wished to come.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_MEET_ACT3">Late! Late you are! And already a mask. Already a face. It is for those without that I must carve. </entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_POST_UNMASK">Have some small reward for your troubles, Old One. It’s no small thing to deliver that sloshing stuff safe, ‘specially all the way up here.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_RELATIONSHIP">A fine face, yours. Not of my work. Not of this kingdom’s craft. Not now at least.<page>But the deeper form. Distant relationship. Some form of Pharloom and our old, legged, stewards. <page>Now! To work. To work! The masks are needed.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_TALK_03"><hpage>You have the sight, Maker. Tell me what you see in me?<page>Your mask... It reads clear enough, Old One. Watcher, hunter, monarch even, though you may reject that station.<page>A complex visage, perhaps, yet still to my sight it looks unresolved.<hpage>If you see a transitional state, it is one I have accepted. My mask has remained defined through lifetimes uncounted.<page>Aye. Rigid I’m sure, but your kind rarely develop evenly, and the lifetime of bugs are poor measure for one like you.<page>Could be there’s more growth awaiting you yet...</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT3_ACT3">Our world cries its end! But the masks must still be carved.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_REPEAT">Enough talk, Old One. Mine is a calling that scant allows rest.<hpage>Very well, Maker. I shall take my leave.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT2">To exist, a face is needed. It is the essential thing.</entry>
