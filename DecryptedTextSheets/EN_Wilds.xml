<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_QUEST_REOFFER">Ready to reconsider my offer? Good for you! You won’t be going far without my help, dear.</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_REPEAT">I’ll grant you my courtesy, stray one. I’ll even offer aid where I’m able. Just don’t be hanging around too long.<page>I may not be a fan of that Citadel, but I’m smart enough to avoid its ire.</entry>
<entry name="ANT_MERCHANT_REPEAT">Kha mauak. Noku gri?</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_REMEET">Back here again? It’s a strange pilgrimage that bends and doubles back on itself. Still, you may as well take the opportunity to share your rosaries.</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_EXTRA_LORE_2_ALT">I’m loath to spoil the surprise, but curiosity begs me to ask. Do you know why they pursued you? Those Citadel bugs?<hpage>I have seen their Citadel and its state, and I have strong suspicion...<hpage>They hunt me for my nature. For the Silk produced within my shell. Not for themselves but for the one atop it all. <page>Ahh ha! Truth. In Pharloom, yours is a rare skill, prized beyond measure, to channel one’s soul within a thread. Soul and Silk inseparably linked.<page>It is a skill almost lost from Pharloom. Those old Weavers shared it, but they’re long dead now.<hpage>The one atop this kingdom... They share my nature, or some part of it. I’ve seen their Silk at work, in vast scale.<hpage>It snares the shells of those upon the roads, and guides with false life the many hollowed husks left to lapse.<page>Hmm... You’ve looked far towards the truth of it. Closer even than I’d dare to dig. But then you’re clearly of the countenance to be coping with such heady stuff...<page>Now! It’s past time you were going! Your style and your Silk sure are fine, but stay too long and you’ll only be trouble for me!</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_QUEST_ACCEPT">A smart choice. Get out there and gather those spine cores, and best you be quick about it.<page>As nice as it is to have the company, if you hang around too long, those Citadel bugs’ll turn their gaze on me as well. </entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_QUEST_OFFER">If you’re planning to ascend from these low fields, you’ll be needing some lift, and I’m just the bug to help.<page>Head for the caves beyond my home. The bugs within produce a spine with a marvellous core, flexible yet strong.<page>Cut their spines and collect the cores. Return to me, and I’ll soon have your old cloak transformed into something far more buoyant.</entry>
<entry name="ANT_QUEEN_BG_MEET">Pale beast... bringing ruin... we had sensed it... you writing harsh our final fate...<page>If power... you come seeking... mine is faded.... mortal... time taken...<hpage>I seek only to save these lands, great one, to break them free from this fatal sickness born of thread and void.<page>Kcha! If you may... beast... If you can... </entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_HANDIN_ASK">Well, then! I can tell by the rattling from within your cloak, your hunt was a success! If you’ll kindly pass over the cores, I can get to work.</entry>
<entry name="ANT_QUEEN_BG_REPEAT">Save them... if you can... pale beast...</entry>
<entry name="RESTING_PILGRIM_REPEAT">Ahhh... I am so tired. But to tarry long would be sacrilege...</entry>
<entry name="HUNTRESS_QUEST_DECLINE">Very well, ssspiidderr. Keep your organsss, for now. </entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_VISITED_CITADEL"><page>Oooh! Stray one. Do tell, how goes the journey?<hpage>I have ventured high, seen the Citadel and its state. That place is long lost... generations lost, a gilded tomb, drowned in Silk dregs.<hpage>For its minions, so compelled in my capture, I now see clearly the source of their unity, and their strange strength... They are husks bound tight by the one who waits at its crest...<page>Agh! Look at you! Seeing right through to the truth of it! Closer even than I’d dare to dig. But then you’re clearly of the countenance to be coping with such heady stuff...<page>Now! Best you be heading. You’re clearly planning to stir up some serious trouble. I don’t want to be close when it kicks off!</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_ITEM_DESC_TOOLPOUCH">That pouch of yours... With the scraps left here and a little work, I could add some pockets for you, let you carry more tools and shards while on the road. That’d be nice, wouldn’t it?</entry>
<entry name="HUNTRESS_REPEAT">All those gooey bugssss, all so reluctant to share their organs. Sssooo much coaxing and gnawing, and prodding.<page>They should be proud! Their ssmall sssacrifice would become much sssustenance for my ferocious young.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_TALK_DELIVERY_POST">For your efforts, take these rosaries as payment. May they not lay too heavy upon your shell.</entry>
<entry name="HUNTRESS_QUEST_ACCEPT"><hpage>I will not offer my own organs, hunter, though I may bring the meat of others slain.<page>Good ssspidderr! Ssskewered. Ssshredded. Ssseared! Bring it all. Much will be needed, enough to sate my brood to come.<hpage>Several of my tools can prepare the meats as you request. I have been fortunate to find so varied an arsenal within your lands.<page>My brood has not long till hatching, ssssspiddderrr. Do your duty ssswift, and you shall sssee reward for the sssslaughter.</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_QUEST_REPEAT"><hpage>I’ll have the spine cores for you shortly, madam.<page>Good, good! The caves just beyond here are full of the creatures, floating carelessly in the warm air.<page>I’m sure your big needle there can coax them into sharing their spines. Then it’s only a quick matter of cutting them open and grabbing the cores.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_ITEM_DESC_WEIGHTED_ANKLET">A holy burden to help maintain your poise. Whether striking others or being struck yourself, you’ll remain firmly in place.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_CANCEL">Not interested in trade? I wonder, will your rosaries weigh you down during your ascent?</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_QUEST_COMPLETE">Perfect! These should be more than enough. Wait there just a moment and we’ll soon have you soaring up and away from these lowlands.</entry>
<entry name="ANT_MERCHANT_MEET">Rkraha. Uohk kha!<hpage>My apologies, sir. Though I can grasp the language of many bugs, your words are unfamiliar even to me.<page>Kha... kha mauak. Noku... gri?<hpage><hpage>These items you have collected. These are the wares of a warrior. Do you wish to trade?<page>Noku... noku!</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_ACT_3_REPEAT">Get a move on, stray one! We’re all suffering for your conflict... Maybe next time you act towards calmer conclusions, aye?</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_ITEM_DESC_SHARD_POUCH">These humble shards can form together into something grand, if you possess the vision to shape them.</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_HANDIN_REFUSE">After all that hunting, you won’t trust me with your spoils? You’re a funny one. They won’t do you any good just filling up your pockets!</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_WEARING_ORDER_BADGE">That’s a fancy pin you’re flaunting upon your cloak there. Here’s hoping you didn’t have to kill to claim it.<hpage>The emblem was given freely, Seamstress, as reward for a fierce duel won fair.<page>Given freely!? My, my. So my sister’s welcomed another to the order... Sounds like age might’ve softened even her stoic style.<page>Can’t say I think too fondly on the old ways... but some rituals, and some memories... those are still worth preserving.</entry>
<entry name="ANT_MERCHANT_SHARD_POUCH_DESC">Rkraha. Tnk uokn.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_PURCHASED">Yes, that’s better. Sharing your devotion with me will surely bring you luck.</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_MEET_ALT">Well, aren’t you a sight! No, don’t tell me! You’re as odd as they come.<page>Your poise! Your form! Are you hunted? Pursued? The Citadel would see a fine prize in you.<hpage>It is as you say, madam. Veiled bugs of the Citadel brought me to your land. I now seek for one who would answer why, and will ask with force as needed.<page>Ha! Fierce too! These are bleak times, but a powerful stray like you could certainly cause some change.<page>Well then! I’ve no love for that holy caste, and I do worry for this kingdom’s ailing state. If you’re seeking to settle a score, perhaps I can lend some aid?</entry>
<entry name="RESTING_PILGRIM_DAZED">Uohhhhh.... Ahhh.....</entry>
<entry name="HUNTRESS_QUEST_REPEAT">I await the meat, sspiidder. Bring me much. Enough to sate my brood to come.</entry>
<entry name="HUNTRESS_MEET">Ssssppiidderr... Your ssstench is strange... yet similar. Your tension isss smelt strong. Do I ssseem a threat to you?<hpage>This whole land keeps me cautious, tall one, and your claws look to have seen much sharp use.<page>Yesss... I kill, gladly, but only to feed my ssshhhell, and my brood to come.<page>Your meat... much ssssustanence it could grant... but too hard to pry... Your long, false claw would ssslash back ssswift.<hpage>Good, so you can sense my skill, as I yours. A truce then, that we both shall live beyond our meeting.</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_ACT_3_MEET">Stray one! Things were already falling grim when last you left. Now it’s worse! The whole world quaking and wailing, and all stretched through with blackened strands! <page>This wouldn’t be your doing, by chance?<hpage>...I am in part responsible, though know this outcome was not my intent, and that I shall work to calm it.<page>I knew it! Course it had to be you. Here I was, hoping you’d bring a shake up. Instead you’ve brought an ending!<page>Well, move it, I say! Get to your fixing. We’re all now suffering for the scale of your conflict... Maybe this time you act towards calmer conclusions, aye?</entry>
<entry name="H_RUNT_QUEST_ACCEPT_LACK_TOOLS"><hpage>In time, child, I may provide the meats, though first I must acquire tools appropriate to the task. My current arsenal will not grant your wish in full.<page>Sssss... Time, yesss?... Then usss too will grow?... Sharpsss clawss... hard shell... like siblings goness...</entry>
<entry name="H_RUNT_QUEST_COMPLETE">Yesss... Now. We’sss too growsss... feastsss... Be like brood... gone... all... far gone...<hpage>Good luck to you, small one. If this land can be saved, I hope you come to find your place within it.</entry>
<entry name="HUNTRESS_QUEST_ACCEPT_LACK_TOOLS"><hpage>I will not offer my own organs, tall one, though I may bring the meat of others slain.<page>Good ssspidderr! Ssskewered. Ssshredded. Ssseared! Bring it all. Much will be needed, enough to sssate my brood to come.<hpage>Your demand is extensive. First, I must acquire tools appropriate to the task. My current arsenal will not grant your wish in full.<page>My brood has not long till hatching, ssssspiddderrr. Find your tools. Do your duty ssswift, and you shall ssee reward for the sssslaughterrr.</entry>
<entry name="ANT_MERCHANT_CURVE_CLAWS_DESC">Auakh khe. Rnka. Uakht rk.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_RUCKUS">That beast! What wicked punishments are sent to test us! Why must we pilgrims, who have done no evil, be so tormented?<page>Tell me, where is it written? This law that says we must suffer every hardship just to earn the merest hope of happiness?<hpage>Wild lands like these are ruled by instinct, not laws. You must rely on your own strength and skill to survive.<page>I have neither! If what you say is true, I may as well crawl outside and let myself be devoured right now. Save myself some worry!<hpage>Do as you wish, but I think perhaps you underestimate yourself. To climb this far and survive here so long is a task beyond most of your fellow pilgrims.<page>Hmph. I’m no better than any of them. It’s only luck that has gotten me this far, and it’s on luck that I shall continue to rely.</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_QUEST_DECLINE">Suit yourself, stray one. Ascending above these fields will prove a tough task without my talent.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_TALK_DELIVERY"><hpage>Sir pilgrim, I bring supplies from Bellhart, for the aid of travellers who pass this waystation.<page>Such service... It seems our prayers do not go completely unheard. Many a small wish will be granted by these supplies.</entry>
<entry name="HUNTRESS_QUEST_REOFFER">Would you gift organs for my brood, sssppiidderr? Upon first waking my children will be consumed with craving.</entry>
<entry name="H_RUNT_MEET_QUEST_ACTIVE"><hpage>I had promised organs for your mother, child. Though she has passed, I would provide them to you, if some small reward were traded?<page>The meatsss?... For ussss?... Yesss, hunter! We have giftssss... Clawsss long...<page>Bring meatssss... Givess meatsss... Usss’s wantss grow sssstrong... much... Be like siblingsss, sharp, hard...</entry>
<entry name="H_RUNT_REPEAT">Even us’sss... Now we’sss too grow... Fiercesss... Hard...<page>We’sss becomesss hunter too...</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_EXTRA_LORE_2">I’m loath to spoil the surprise, but curiosity begs me to ask. Do you know why they pursue you? Those Citadel bugs?<hpage>No certainty, but I’ve a strong suspicion...<hpage>They hunt me for my nature. For the Silk produced within my shell.<page>Ahh ha! Truth, no doubt! In Pharloom, yours is a rare skill, prized beyond measure, to channel one’s soul within a thread. Soul and Silk inseparably linked.<page>It is a skill almost lost from Pharloom. Those old Weavers shared it, but they’re long dead now.<hpage>There is another alive in this kingdom that shares my nature, or some part of it. I’ve seen Silk similar to my own. It snares the shells of those upon the roads.<hpage>I’ve seen it wrap them, possess them whole. There is will within that thread, one that seems to come from somewhere above us. The Citadel...<page>Hmmmm... Good, sharp sight you’ve got. That Citadel... All roads towards and all answers waiting, and a long climb up there m’dear.<page>Now! It’s time you get going! Your style and your Silk sure are fine, but stay too long and you’ll only be trouble for me!</entry>
<entry name="H_RUNT_QUEST_COMPLETE_DECLINE">She keepsss?.. We’sss wants meatsss, hunter... We’sss need strengthsss... As much as othersss... As much as mothersss...</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_ITEM_DESC_LOCKET">Memories only weigh us down, but some pilgrims still cling to them with unseemly devotion. This memory isn’t yours, but perhaps you could find some use for it?</entry>
<entry name="ANT_MERCHANT_FRACTURED_MASK_DESC">Kha uokn. Krka tih.</entry>
<entry name="H_RUNT_QUEST_REOFFER">Us needssss meatsss... hunter... finds... bringsss... So us’sss small does grow like siblingssss...</entry>
<entry name="H_RUNT_QUEST_COMPLETE_PRE">The meatssss... smellsss... You bring?... To grow usss like siblings, strong in ssshellsss?</entry>
<entry name="H_RUNT_QUEST_ACCEPT"><hpage>Several of my tools can prepare the meats as you request, child. In time, I shall see your wish granted.<page>Sssss... Usss too will grow?... Sharps claws... hard shell... like siblings goness...</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_EXTRA_LORE_1">Just a moment, dear, before you scurry off!</entry>
<entry name="HUNTRESS_QUEST_COMPLETE">You’ve done well, sspppidderrr. Upon these fine meats my children will gorge and grow. <hpage>And better the organs of others than they feed upon your own, yes?<page>Sssssskkkk... One should not be surprised, for the sssspppider to perceive the truth of my requests. <hpage>A child of one like you, many times I’ve seen it similar. They will be born hungry, with sharp tooth and claw.<hpage>In their birth-craze, your own meat would delight as much as another bug’s. This feast is distraction, in hope to save your shell.<page>Is that shameful? A mother who would not sacrifice herself for her children to grow sssstttrong? Is it wrong to want? To witnesss their first flight, their first hunt. To see them kill, and grow? <hpage>Your choice is your own, tall mother. You won’t be judged by me. I’ve seen enough sacrifice. I’ve no love for the act.</entry>
<entry name="ANT_QUEEN_HASMELODY_FLOWER_OWNED">Pale beast... bringing ruin... we had sensed it... you writing, harsh, our final fate...<page>If power... you come seeking... mine is faded.... mortal... time taken...<hpage>Great one, I come not to see you as you are, rather I would know you as were, before the pale monarch, when once your heart beat bright and brave.<page>Kcha! Then see me... beast... Those distant memories... Mine once was power... wild... proud...</entry>
<entry name="ANT_QUEEN_HASMELODY_REPEAT">My strength... my power... Could you claim it, pale beast? Are you so strong?...<hpage>Let us find out together, great one...</entry>
<entry name="H_RUNT_QUEST_REPEAT">Bringsss meatsss... Hunter... many...<page>Usss too be strong... large... one of brood...</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_BROLLY_AFTER_GET"><hpage>This is fine work, Seamstress. Your modifications will aid me greatly.<page>You’re quite welcome, dear. I’ve rare opportunity to practice such intricate sewing, and a warrior sort like you will be able to properly appreciate my additions.<page>Float away now, stray one, and do try not to die. I’d rather not have my hard work go to waste.</entry>
<entry name="HUNTRESS_TALK_CITADEL">Have you seen it... small sspidderrr.... that cruel Citadel, weighing heavy atop tthissss land?<page>My hunger may seem great, but that place... that is consumption unending...</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_TALK_REPEAT">We pilgrims provide for each other, living or dead. Sharing is a sign of devotion, particularly for those who give.</entry>
<entry name="HUNTRESS_QUEST_OFFER">You stay, ssppidderrr? My brood needsss meat, much.. the organsss of othersss, or would you instead offer your own?<page>Gift a sshhell’s warm insidess as sweet feast for my brood’sss birth-meal?</entry>
<entry name="HUNTRESS_QUEST_COMPLETE_PRE">You have them, sspiiddderrr! The smell is upon you, all those organs, rich prepared for feasssting.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_MEET">Come to rest your weary body? The climb is agonising, and even the devout must mind their limits.<hpage>I’m impressed to find any without firm claw upon a weapon that could ascend so far.<page>Indeed. We’re lucky to have made it here. Luckier than many others. Or perhaps the difference between the lucky and unlucky is merely faith?<page>Now, while we rest, shall we make trade? If you have rosaries, I’ll take them gladly.</entry>
<entry name="H_RUNT_QUEST_OFFER">Hunter... stayss... Shining claw... still... Does themsss help... seek?<page>Usss need meatsss, much, too... Hunter... Usss wants many... Seared... Skewered... Shredded...<page>Usss’s wantss grow sssstrong... much... Be like siblingsss, sharp, hard.</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_MEET">Well, aren’t you a sight! No, don’t tell me! You’re as odd as they come.<page>Your poise! Your form! Are you hunted? Pursued? The Citadel would see a fine prize in you.<hpage>It is as you say, madam. Veiled bugs brought me to your land. I seek them now, for answers.<page>Ha! Fierce too! These are bleak times, but a powerful stray like you could certainly cause some change.<page>Well then! I’ve no love for that holy caste, and I do worry for this kingdom’s ailing state. If you’re seeking to settle a score, perhaps I can lend some aid?</entry>
<entry name="H_RUNT_MEET">Hunter... Shining claw... Do not killsss... Mine is ssshell thin. Taste is poor...<page>Me’sss born not like siblingsss, themsss large and hard... All themsss did feasted and flew.<hpage>I see it clear, child. The tall mother’s meat has fed the brood fresh hatched.<hpage>It was a common fate that found her. Too common, perhaps...<page>Gone... the mother, her meatsss... and lifesss... for siblingss strong... not for usss so small... Neverss for usss...</entry>

<entry name="H_RUNT_QUEST_DECLINE"><hpage>Your land’s fate has turned too dire, child. I cannot delay now to help you in your growth.<page>Sssss... So huntersss live... kill... only for selvesss... same as siblings...</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_TALK2">These fields are hot and harsh, a miserable place for we pilgrims, and just above are the dreary moors, a place once of abundance lost to falling silt and murky rain.<page>The lands in every direction punish us, but such is our test. Above it all, the Citadel shines, our destination and our reward...<page>I’ll make it there, you’ll see. I’ve easily earned my place in such a paradise.</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_TALK1"><hpage>Is this place your permanent home, sir, or do you only make camp?<page>We pilgrims have no home, there is only the path. We climb, and suffer, and are thusly judged.<page>I will linger here only a moment, for the sake of trade. Once I’ve gathered enough rosaries, I’ll be holy enough to ascend without fear.</entry>
<entry name="SEAMSTRESS_MET_PINSTRESS"><hpage>On the far side of Pharloom, I chanced upon a bug starkly similar to yourself.<hpage>From her home, her dress, and her skill, I am guessing you share some relation?<page>Aye. Met my sister, you did, in order at least. Glad to hear she’s still among the living.<page>Last to hold true to the old ways of the pin, she was... I sure ain’t sharing many of those violent values no more.<page>I’ll warn you, stray one, my sister might seem all cheer and charm, but buried beneath there’s the soul of a killer.</entry>
<entry name="HUNTRESS_QUEST_COMPLETE_DECLINE">You would deny my brood their strength, ssspiidderr? A cruel creature you are. Surely your sssmall shell needs hardly so much?</entry>
<entry name="PILGRIM_REST_SHOP_ITEM_DESC_COINSET_S">I’ll string your rosaries tight, for a modest fee. It’s the safest way to keep them close.</entry>
<entry name="RESTING_PILGRIM_MEET">Uoohhh... Sister, my aching shell’s close to breaking. My voice weakens... I can hardly sing a word.<hpage>I fear the path ahead will be no easier for you, ma’am. If you can not abandon your pilgrimage, you should at least rest well before continuing.<page>Ahh... but impurities stalk our every step, sister. If we rest too long, they shall catch us. So... so it is sung...</entry>
