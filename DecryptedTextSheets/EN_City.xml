<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_REPEAT">Leave us! My great master needs time to reflect, and I must ponder on flavours anew!</entry>
<entry name="COG_STATUE_ALL_TALK_B">Pilgrim who would hold our song within your shell, rise above.<page>Offer your most devout self unto our sacred heart. </entry>

<entry name="SONG_KNIGHT_OUTRO_2">Accept, a t-t-token of the sentinel’s order.<page>As friends... let us p-part.</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_NO_RELICS_FULL"><hpage>I would view your collection, Vaultkeeper.<page>She may see it. A perfect set. This Vaultkeeper is rich with insights. Jealous its fellows would be... If still their minds remained.</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_ITEM_GIVE_MEAT">Aaaahh. What’s this? The rasher of a courier, tied up tight! I can see its fat still dripping fresh!</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_ITEM_GIVE_STEW">This stew, of Mossberries stirred thick. Good. Good! It shall form the base once set in mould.</entry>
<entry name="SLAB_PRISONER_REMEET">Ahh... you have brought song again, though perhaps it is wasted on one as unworthy as I.<hpage>You needn’t satisfy my curiosity if it pains you, sir, but I must ask, for what crime or sin did the Citadel imprison you?<page>My sin? A grave transgression, the cause of much pain for many. But to speak of a sin... is to invite its return. I will say no more.</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_RELIC_ASK_PROMPT">Give Psalm Cylinder?</entry>
<entry name="SONG_KNIGHT_OUTRO_1">By the purity of your will... the c-c-clarity of your intent... you are innocent of the silken curse.<page>Failed, has this sentinel. Your j-judgment, will it accept.<hpage>Is this truly failure, gilded one? You meant to test me and have done so. I would expect nothing less of a true guardian.<hpage>The matter is resolved. There is no need for death. Stand, and let us part as friends.</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_ROACHEGG">Seek out a Pickled Muckmaggot, the sacred treat revered and reviled for its intensity. It was a specialty of the chef Lugoli, long ago banished for culinary sacrilege.<page>Rumours sing that the great chef retreated to their home-caves in the dank midlands below...</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_QUEST_COMPLETE_1"><hpage>With this I have fulfilled my promise, sir. The ingredients have all been delivered. I trust now the meal can be made, and the oil awarded for my efforts?<page>You’ll have your oil, whelp! Firstly learn some patience! The dish must be prepared perfectly, enough to rouse my master and see them sated. <page>Now! Permit me to work my skill, and you’ll stand to see a meal of scent and taste that would dazzle Pharloom in her prime!</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_MEET_ACT3">Hrm? Oh, ‘tis merely the livid red bug. I was expecting some word from those above to explain the meaning of all this rumbling and shaking.<page>They fail in their holy duties! My master must be shielded from such inconveniences, else their digestion be disrupted.<hpage>There are worse fates than indigestion, sir. You are fortunate to be unharmed.<page>Fortune has nothing to do with it. I am simply of a hardier breed than the insipid young servants of these recent, wretched times!</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_FIRST_RELIC_ASK_REPEAT">Rkkt! I know she has it. Keeps it. Carried coveted in her cloth. This one searched for it. Give it! Give it to us!</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_MELODY_PLAY_POST">Divine music... The soul of Pharloom eternal laid bare... That our cursed age could still receive such blessing...<page>So, Weaver-spawn, our melody is yours now, held in mind to carry beyond our walls. Was the learning worth its thieving? <hpage>It was, Vaultkeeper. And know to me your service continues. Keep the cylinder safe, along with any others I may bring.</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARY_STATUE_SPEAK_REPEAT">...Dear... grim... Dark it seems now... et these word... become your guide...<page>Hear our voice... Let it... your own! Give... of yourself... for great Pharloom, for... first-children who bequeath it to us... for our salva... sure to come!</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_NECTAR">For a sweet simmer, find me some Vintage Nectar. A rare brew, treasured by bugs with a keen scent for excellence.<page>There’s slim chance such an old yield might still exist. Alas! Its depth of flavour is a necessity for the holy dish!</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARY_STATUE_WAKEUP">Hark! ...ilgrim! You... climb... our eternal embrace... who stand stru... the threshold... our stark Citadel of stone... kno... true service may now commence.<page>Forget... your weary shell. Forgo... urge to still... arloom commands... give... greatest gift! Join our chor... Raise... shell... voice... and sing!</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_COURIERMEAT">For the core of the meal, find that marvellous meat... The rasher of a courier, those spritely bugs who once arrived at the toll of every second bell.<page>I saw many a courier gorge upon this fatty snack. Where are they all? Have they abandoned their holy toil?</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_REPEAT_ACT3">The master has a mighty endurance, yet all of this rumbling and breaking makes me fearful for their safety.<page>Fear not. I will stay by their side until my old shell crumbles away.</entry>
<entry name="BROOD_MOTHER_TINY_TALK">Eggy, eggy, hee hee! I’ll eat a lot, grow big and fat. Then I’ll lay a lot of eggies!<page>They bring me plenty of food, so they must want plenty of eggies.<page>And plenty they shall have, if they’re nice to me! Hee hee!</entry>
<entry name="SONG_KNIGHT_INTRO_2"><hpage>I had thought I was answering your summons as a friend, or at least an ally, but now that we stand together in this place I can sense your intent.<hpage>You mean to raise your blades against me. Am I your enemy, then?<page>D-defence of the sacred Citadel, and the voices that fill it-t-t, is the eternal duty of the sentinels.<page>Termination, is the n-n-necessary fate of all those enthralled by the whispering Silk.<hpage>You believe me haunted, a slave to the pale threads? I think you are more perceptive than that. My Silk is my own, as is my will.<page>Unsure, is this sentinel. B-both haunted and innocent, you seem. With regret, this sentinel must t-t-test the strength of your will.</entry>
<entry name="WARD_PIT_KEYHOLE_INSPECT">An ornate lock mechanism with a keyhole at its centre.</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_ITEM_GIVE_NECTAR">The nectar! To think, such an aged extract still exists! What an exquisite tragedy that I cannot taste it myself. My master must have every drop!</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_FIRST_RELIC_GOT">Yes! Yes! She gives... It is ours! <hpage>I have passed the relic, Vaultkeeper. Now uphold your promise and aid me with your insight.<page>Fool! Demanding of a Vaultkeeper. Hers is impudence enough to bring death... If she did not carry the scent of Weaver-spawn.<hpage>So you know something of my ancestry, learned bug. If it gains me favour here, then I’ll expect your service in full.<page>Bleg! Dead! Dead, your vicious kind are meant to be. Better methinks to stay as such... <page>Gkkkt. But this one was taught. It shall fold its claws. It shall pass its knowledge, as much as is gleaned.<page>Only to a first child must a Vaultkeeper defer.</entry>
<entry name="TROBBIO_BOSS_MEET">Oh drab and trembling squib, you who timidly step upon the Great Stage, fate has seen you chosen!<page>Cast away your fear and join me as my partner. Pharloom’s flame may flicker, but together we shall spark it ablaze!<page>Let us enliven this Citadel lost to silence! Let us rouse the soul of this once great land!</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_QUEST"><hpage>Vaultkeeper, I am seeking a melody held by your vaults, part of a set to open a path above. Tell me what you know of it.<page>The Weaver-thing would claim our sacred melody?! How grim the age we survive to see... Vile sacrilege for it to pass to an outsider...<page>Only our pontiff, lived long and low within our vault, they held the melody, jealously, covetously... A learning for the highest Vaultkeeper, and them alone.<page>A truth they were told to have found... There in the dark. Something within the melody, or the words. Something to set them silent... <hpage>I am not afraid of what I’ll hear, Vaultkeeper. If your pontiff and their melody wait below, I shall find them both.</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_RELIC_GOT">Yes! A fair gift, Weaver-spawn. This Vaultkeeper shall glean what knowledge a great mind can. </entry>
<entry name="COG_STATUE_CONDUCTOR_TALK_B">As it was sung, our song sustains.<page>For Pharloom eternal, we shall guide.</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_RELIC_ASK">Grkkt. What has she brought it? More treasures waiting on a Keeper’s insight, yes? The sacred cylinders of our holy Citadel? Pass them. Give them. Now! She must!</entry>
<entry name="SONG_KNIGHT_INTRO_1"><hpage>I am here, gilded one.</entry>
<entry name="SONG_KNIGHT_MEET_2">Eternal, is the Citadel. Et-t-ternal, is the devotion of the sentinels.<page>While its shell is f-f-functional, this sentinel will hold true to its duty.</entry>
<entry name="COG_STATUE_ALL_TALK_FIRST">Pilgrim of Pharloom eternal, you rare chosen who hath ascended to this final threshold, listen to our wish, deliver it, that you may rise above and see your pilgrimage end.</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_SIMPLE_MELODY">Interloper! On you, our pontiff’s sacred melody! You have found it, hold it, and now you dally, lost like a mite in our shelves!<page>Return to the listening room below! The sacred cylinder can be played, and the melody of our vaults heard at last in this damned age stretched long.</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_QUEST_COMPLETE_2">Taste, smell, texture... It is done! A meal to rival Pharloom’s finest.<page>Mighty master, how long you have waited to set your jaw upon so perfect a dish! Join us, and dine!</entry>
<entry name="BROOD_MOTHER_TINY_MEET">Yummy, yummy... oh! Are you here to serve me?<hpage>I am merely a visitor here, little one. Have you made this place your home, then?<page>My home? Oh yes! Lovely and warm. The big ones, they bring me food whenever I’m hungry. And I’m hungry now!</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_QUEST_REFUSE"><hpage>I have more pressing tasks, sir. Perhaps your master should content themself with a humbler meal?<page>Blasphemy! My master shall have the holy indulgence they deserve, even if I must douse my shell in oil and climb onto a dish myself!</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_CRUSTNUT">To season a meal such as this... only a Crustnut will do. Once, scores of them could be gathered, high atop those coral crusted caves beyond the Grand Gate.<page>Surely some must still grow within that sand-ravaged land?</entry>
<entry name="COG_STATUE_LIBRARIAN_TALK_B">As it was sung, our song sustains.<page>For Pharloom eternal, we shall teach.</entry>
<entry name="COG_STATUE_LIBRARIAN_TALK_A">We would hear the voice of the Keepers, within their grand vaults.<page>They who guard our history, our prayers and our secrets, across the ages.</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_ITEM_GIVE_EGG">Pickled Muckmaggot! So that banished chef’s recipes outlived them after all!<hpage>Not so, sir. I claimed the maggot from the chef themself. Their brutish work continued, even with their shell claimed by cursed thread.<page>Incredible! A bug so devout, they could cook with mind expunged. This Citadel was far too hasty to expel such brilliance.</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_QUEST_ACCEPTED"><hpage>I could track down any ingredient you desire, for a price. The oil you keep here may be of some use to me.<hpage>Promise it as reward, and your master shall have his meal.<page>Hrmph! Such a squalid bargain ill befits a holy servant... but so be it. Fetch me the ingredients and you shall have that pale condiment for yourself!</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_MEET">What an awful clattering! Would you kindly conduct yourself a little more carefully?<page>And why are you adorned in such an awful, livid red? By my oath, those above must make a sport of sending me the most wretched servants they can find!<hpage>I am no servant, sir, rather a guest of sorts, invited by the Citadel. Tell me, is this vial of oil on display your own?<page>Nothing here is my own, you impertinent young mite! This sacred hall, and all the food contained within, belong to my most exalted master.<page>The Great Gourmand! The finest connoisseur who has ever lived, the one whose tastes transcend the ages!<page>None are left now who venerate them as they deserve, save for the loyal, lonely bug who stands before you.<page>That oil is merely a small savoury to whet their appetite for the grand meal to come. A spectacular, Pharloom spanning dish that I have been planning for an age.<page>But alas, those above seem to have forsaken my poor master! And I have grown so old. Now I can never hope to gather the necessary ingredients. Blast their indolence!</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_TINKED_RETURN">Horrid she! What fool dares strike a holy Vaultkeeper! It has knowledge! Insight! As much as any could possibly retain in our fallen age.<page>Would she cast it all aside just to create more death? If so, she is Weaver to the core!</entry>
<entry name="TORMENTED_TROBBIO_DEFEAT">So be it, impudent louse! Deny our kingdom’s agony. Refuse its touch upon your fickle shell!<page>Carve your hapless path. Stalk, and strike, and fight, but know your foe is fate herself, and she has risen raging!</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_ACT3_MEET">Pain! Pain! Do you hear her cries, cursed spider-spawn!? Pharloom suffers for our pathetic, mortal ignorance! We fail it and it falls! <page>Knowledge is needed. More and more! It must be hoarded, sought! Strength to understand, to calm and quell.<hpage>It is action now that needs taking, Vaultkeeper, by myself and those left alive who would aid me.<hpage>Seek solutions in your texts and psalms as you may, but they alone will not be enough to heal a pain so great.</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_ALL_RELICS">Yessss! See them all! Its collection gleams complete. Such sacred understanding, stored safe.<page>You have performed your part, Weaver-spawn... The agreement is concluded. Knowledge and rosaries, all were passed fair. No more between us.<page>Leave this Keeper to its treasures and their insights. It has given its service. Now this Keeper wants its time alone! </entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_NO_RELICS"><hpage>Show me your collection, Vaultkeeper.<page>Grkt, Weaver-spawn! She is a bother! Nuisance! Bring more gifts. The collection still has gaps!</entry>
<entry name="SONG_KNIGHT_RESTING_MEET_ACT3"><hpage>Gilded one, what remained of the Citadel has been torn apart by the black threads. Still you keep to your duty?<page>While voices still fill the g-g-great chambers... the sacred task of the sentinels continues.<page>To defend... To p-p-protect.</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_QUEST_REPEAT">You dally, still? If you wish to earn your reward, you should be hunting down those ingredients! Or do you need directions from a serving-bug with some experience?</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_MELODY_PLAY_PRE">The Weaver-spawn, she has found it! Our pontiff’s sacred cylinder, stolen from the dark below...<page>Never! States our law. Never must our melody pass to a bug not Keeper! But you, fool Weaver, would shatter those tenets with reckless ease.<hpage>Your pontiff is gone, Vaultkeeper. Your fellows have fallen to husk or thread. What laws once bound these vaults died with them.<page>Ackk! Fine, cursed she. Claim the sacred song, and pain to you if we both are damned forever for it!</entry>
<entry name="LAST_CONDUCTOR_MEET_VAR"><hpage>I return, bug, and ask to hear your melody again, that I may lock it clear in my mind.<page>Very well, good pilgrim. For one so fiercely devout as yourself, gladly will I give this gift.</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_QUEST_REWARD"><hpage>Your master seems satisfied, sir. It is time you gave what was promised.<page>Yes. Yes! It has been done! Made and served. A dish to match my master’s refined desires.<page>The pale trifle is yours. Take it and leave! My master needs time to reflect, and I must ponder on flavours anew!</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_RELIC_ASK_MELODY_REOFFER"><hpage>Vaultkeeper, I bring the psalm cylinder recovered from the dark chambers below here. I would learn its melody.<page>Kak! Then pass it, filthy Weaver-spawn! A cylinder so sacred should not remain a moment longer in your grubby claws!</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_RELIC_DECLINED">Hold them, will she? Covet them? Can she not part with such a small prize?<page>Remain blind fool she. This Keeper’s understanding stays with itself. </entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_SIMPLE_2_TALK">Weaver-thing! Does she hope to spy upon our treasured records?<page>Within our vast store, always more there is to know, the old methods of prayer, to this land, to its rulers, and to the strength at its heart.        </entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_FIRST_RELIC_ASK">She carries a precious cylinder! She must give it! Share it! Claw to claw!<page>Pass it! And this Vaultkeeper shall grant their wisdom. Just a small taste! A trickle! A glimmer! Of our Citadel’s sacred understandings. </entry>
<entry name="SONG_KNIGHT_MEET_1">Woken, is this sentinel. F-f-f-functional, is its shell.<page>Still devoted, is this s-s-sentinel, and awaiting your commandment.<hpage>You speak, gilded one? I’ve no command for you, but my curiosity is piqued.<hpage>You call yourself a sentinel. What is it you are charged with protecting?<page>Defence of the sacred C-c-citadel, and the voices that fill it-t-t, is our eternal duty.<hpage>I had assumed as much. Yet look around you, gilded one. During your slumber, the Citadel has fallen, and its voices lay silent. This place is dead, or very nearly.<hpage>Some would argue that standing guard over a kingdom’s corpse is a foolish task, empty of meaning. I wonder then, will you still hold true to your charge?</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_SIMPLE_1_TALK">One must not wander idle between these sacred shelves! This is a holy place. Reverence! It is demanded.<page>If the fool she wishes to view this Keeper’s collection, head to the listening room below.</entry>
<entry name="SURFACE_EDGE_REPEAT"><hpage>My choice is made. I cannot leave. I must descend again, and see Pharloom freed.</entry>
<entry name="SONG_KNIGHT_RESTING_MEET"><hpage>The signs of battle here are clear, gilded one. Is it your charge then to hunt the haunted, even if they be of the Citadel’s ruling castes?<page>Defence of the sacred Cit-t-tadel, and the voices that fill it, is the eternal d-duty of the sentinels.<page>Termination, is the n-n-necessary fate of all those enthralled by the whispering Silk.</entry>
<entry name="SURFACE_EDGE"><hpage>Out there lie the endless wastes... If I cross them now, Pharloom shall fall to a black fate of my making.<hpage>My choice is made. I will not abandon its bugs to that grim end. I must descend again, and cut them free.</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_CLOSED_FIRST"><hpage>Keep safe, Vaultkeeper. I may expect your service in future, and I’d not have you pass before that task is complete.<page>Gyak... No fool this Keeper. It has lived long, watched its fellows wither, but it shall not die, not yet, not while knowledge needs be sought.<page>This pact is made, Weaver-spawn, insight for us, both she and it.<page>This holy Citadel, in glory and fall, there are holes in its history, even to a Keeper’s knowledge, even to the vaults.<page>Seek the cylinders, she must, those objects of intricate insight. Bring more for this Keeper and only this Keeper, for in this Citadel none are left possessed of such sound, sharp mind as it.</entry>
<entry name="COG_STATUE_ALL_TALK_A">Pilgrim of Pharloom eternal, regale us with our Threefold song, that you may rise above and worship before our kingdom’s divine heart. </entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_OFFER">Still you tarry here, bug who calls herself a guest? If your idle claws need work, put them to service for our exalted Great Gourmand!<page>I must remain by my master, so you will need to leave the Citadel and gather the ingredients for their meal in my stead!</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARY_STATUE_INSPECT">A rusted statue of a pilgrim.</entry>
<entry name="MELODY_PICKUP_HINT_MET"><hpage>To learn the melody upon this cylinder will require a working listening device. This one here has long ceased to function.<hpage>That last keeper still sane, in the vaults above... Their chambers hold just such a machine. I need only return.</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_RELIC_ASK_MELODY"><hpage>Vaultkeeper, I recovered a psalm cylinder in the dark chambers below here. I believe it contains the melody unique to these vaults. I would have you play it for me now.<page>Kakrt! She has visited the pontiff’s depths and stolen the sacred song! Where is your respect, Weaver-spawn?! Our venerable dead deserve better than to have their chambers transgressed by your filthy foraging!<hpage>In this moment, Vaultkeeper, I’ve slim patience for your impudence. Either prepare the cylinder and stay silent, or ready yourself to learn regret.</entry>
<entry name="BROOD_MOTHER_TINY_REPEAT">Eggy, eggy! I want to lay a lot of pretty eggies! So tell the big ones, bring me more food!</entry>
<entry name="LAST_CONDUCTOR_WEAVERS"><hpage>Your chambers are surely grand, sir bug, but it is plain to see you are no sovereign here.<page>Is our state so bare, pilgrim?... “By the will of the Conductors,” we once boomed, and this Citadel shook at our decree.<page>But the words... How hollow they echoed. The mantle of rule, claimed greedily from Pharloom’s fading first children, those bitter Weavers... it was yoke, not crown.<page>Now, in our Citadel’s silence, we share their truth. Only one monarch’s claws ever clutched this kingdom, though we raised our voices to cry otherwise.<page>Would you see her, pilgrim? Up there at our Citadel’s crown? Reach those heights we’d hoped to hide and bow before this land’s true ruler.<hpage>In time near, sir bug, I shall indeed climb to meet your monarch...</entry>
<entry name="SONG_KNIGHT_RESTING_REPEAT">Cleansed, is this place. Eternal, is the d-d-duty of the sentinels.</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_ITEM_HAS"><hpage>Sir, I bring ingredients for the dish.<page>At last! My master is withering away from hunger! Let us see what gifts you bring.</entry>
<entry name="SLAB_PRISONER_TALK2"><hpage>Will you tell me of those who guard this structure? They are servants of the Citadel, are they not?<page>Servants...? They too are penitents. In a past age, that caste committed their own sacrilege against the Citadel.<page>A sin long forgotten, but so grave that their offspring and the offspring of their offspring carry the guilt with them still. To serve here is their only hope of absolution.</entry>
<entry name="COG_STATUE_ALL_TALK_A_REPEAT">Pilgrim of Pharloom eternal, regale us with our Threefold song, that you may rise above and worship before our kingdom’s divine heart. </entry>
<entry name="SLAB_PRISONER_TALK1"><hpage>If this place was holy once, no evidence remains. Even as a prison, it has been neglected.<hpage>If you wish, I can free you. You can descend through the caverns below until you find a settlement.<page>You... are asking me to leave this place? Wh-what a strange, fearful thought! Such a sin would never... no.<page>By the grace of the Citadel, I am here as a penitent. Here, I can hide from the shame of my sins until they are withered away by time.<page>Leave this place...? Please! Strike me down dead before you speak such blasphemy again!</entry>
<entry name="LAST_CONDUCTOR_REPEAT">The mantle of conductor weighs heavy. Had I known the cost before its bearing, would I have accepted the duty?</entry>
<entry name="SLAB_PRISONER_MEET">S... song, is it? You have brought song? You are of the Citadel, then? How... how many of you?<hpage>I am alone, sir. You needn’t fear, I am no servant of the Citadel. Are you a prisoner of theirs?<page>P... prisoner? I understand you not. There is no prison here.<page>This is a holy place of forgiveness. Please, speak with reverence.</entry>
<entry name="COG_STATUE_ARCHITECT_TALK_B">As it was sung, our song sustains.<page>For Pharloom eternal, we shall build.</entry>
<entry name="COG_STATUE_ARCHITECT_TALK_A">We would hear the song of the Architects, at the core of our Citadel.<page>They who sustain our realm, its walls, its floors and its voice, even as others fall silent.</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_ITEM_GIVE_CORAL">A Crustnut! Stale and dull, you’ll be thinking, yes? But ground to finest powder, that’s when its tart taste blooms!</entry>
<entry name="MELODY_PICKUP_HINT_NOTMET"><hpage>If I’m to learn the melody upon this cylinder, I’ll first need to find a working device to play it. This one here has long ceased to function.<hpage>The vaults above would surely hold another such device. I must search thoroughly.</entry>
<entry name="TORMENTED_TROBBIO_MEET">You! Mite or mourner! Fell fated chosen left till last!<page>Relent! Submit! The fatal blow was struck. Fair Pharloom wails its end.<page>We woe befallen few remained, let us join here, at last, and show our fires fierce.<page>Together to share our kingdom’s pain, feel it scorch our shells, and know clear its suffering, its sorrow!</entry>
<entry name="LAST_CONDUCTOR_GIVE">Our song upon a silken thread.... Such beautiful sound, so long absent from our halls.<page>Keep safe our melody, good pilgrim. You shall likely be the last to receive it.</entry>
<entry name="COG_STATUE_CONDUCTOR_TALK_A">We would hear the melody of the Conductors, high in their gleaming towers.<page>They bearing the heaviest mantle, who would guide our land ever on to greatness. </entry>
<entry name="LAST_CONDUCTOR_MEET">A visitor? Now this is rare.<page>I must apologise for not rising to greet you. After an age spent sickly, I find myself unable to lift from this bedchamber.<page>I hope, good pilgrim, our Citadel has shown you the courtesy deserved of a bug devout.<hpage>I’ve borne its hospitality well enough, aged one...<page>Ahhh... My sympathies, pilgrim... We have fallen so far. And now, sadly, if you’ve come seeking aid or understanding, I fear I too shall disappoint. <page>Whatever you would ask, I have only my melody left to offer. It is a simple thing, the smallest of gifts, but perhaps more special now, for it has been rarely heard in these quietened times.</entry>
<entry name="SLAB_PRISONER_REPEAT">If the weight of your sins bear down upon you, you may remain here with me in penitence, sister.</entry>
<entry name="SLAB_PRISONER_NEEDOLIN">Ah.... your s-song. So long I’ve sat in silence. Tell me... are all songs played now as exquisite as this? Or has time made my hearing unrefined?<hpage>This art is new to me, and my skill is limited, but your appreciation is not unwelcome.<page>Ahh. The beauty of it. It is almost painful to my weary senses. Perhaps though, this pain is merely part of my penitence. <page>Play on, will you? I would join your tune. Just forgive me if my voice has become brutish.</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_MELODY_NOPLAY">You refuse to play our sacred melody! Why pause, Weaver-thing? Do you cower at the truths it may illuminate? Surely you are not the lesser sort that bows to fear?<hpage>When the moment calls, Vaultkeeper, I shall listen. For now, your task remains to keep the cylinder safe. And know, you shall answer to my blade if you fail.</entry>
<entry name="LIBRARIAN_RELIC_ASK_PROMPT_PLURAL">Give Psalm Cylinders?</entry>
<entry name="GOURMAND_SERVANT_MOSSSTEW">For our base, we require the gelatinous Mossberry Stew. Its concoction is a druidic art, a jealously guarded secret of the moss-painted caverns deep below us.</entry>
